# Data and code corresponding to the analysis of:

_Lamy-Besnier et al. (2025) GlaF is a Gp2.5-like annealase that defines a new family of phage recombinases associated with duplication-rich Felixounavirus genomes_

### Data

The data necessary to reproduce the analysis can be found in the "Data" folder.

It is composed of a 5 files :

- *Frub.tsv*: a tsv table containing the FRUB output for the INHPARED 5,226 genomes.
- *INHPARED.tsv*: a tsv table containing the full information, including taxonomy, of the INPHARED 5,226 genomes.
- *Felixounavirus.tsv*: a tsv table containing the FRUB output for the 91 Felixounavirus genomes downloaded on NCBI.
- *Integrases.txt*: a txt table containing the output of the integrase search for the INHPARED 5,226 genomes.
- *Recombinases.txt*: a txt table containing the output of the recombinase search for the INHPARED 5,226 genomes.

### Code

The code corresponding to the data analysis can be found in the "Code" folder.

It is composed of a single RMarkdown file, which generates the corresponding figures found in the manuscript.

### Issues

Feel free to report any code-related issue or question in the corresponding section of the GitHub repository or by emailing the corresponding authors of the manuscript.
